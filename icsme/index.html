        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p align="justify">Software evolution is a fundamental process that
         transcends the realm of technical artifacts and permeates the
         entire organizational structure. By means of a longitudinal empirical study of 16 large open-source projects,
         we examine and discuss the evolutionary principles that govern the coordination of developers.
         By applying a network-theoretic approach, we found that the implicit and self-organizing structure
         of developer coordination is ubiquitously described
         by nonrandom organizational principles that defy conventional
         software-engineering wisdom. In particular, we found that: (a) developers form scale-free networks,
         in which the majority of coordination is primarily managed by a small number of developers, (b)
         developers tend to become more coordinated over time, limited by an upper bound,
         and (c) initially developers are hierarchically arranged, but over time, form a unique hybrid structure,
         in which core developers are hierarchically arranged and peripheral developers are not. Our results suggest that
         the organizational structure of large projects is constrained to evolve towards a state that
         balances the costs and benefits of developer coordination, and the mechanisms used
         to achieve this state depend on the project's scale.<p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p align="justify">An example developer network is shown on
          the right. Each bounding box represents a single community of
          developers. The border color of each box uniquely identifies
          each community, and pie charts are used to represent each
          developer's fractional participation in a community. The box
          background color is used to represent the strength of each
          community, calculated according to conductance (cf. full
          paper). Green signifies a strong community, yellow a weak
          community, and red an anti-community. Intracommunity edges are
          shown in black, and intercommunity edges are shown in red. The
          edge thickness represents the strength of a relationship.
          PageRank centrality was used to identify important developers
          and is represented by the size of each node. We filter the
          inter-community-edges to reduce clutter by aggregating the
          edge multiplicity between two communities into a single edge,
          connecting the two most important developers. The weight of an
          inter-community edge represents the total collaboration
          between all nodes in the connected communities.</p>
